# HelpingMyMama

A new Flutter project for my mama! As a teacher, she feel confuse in classroom management, the biggest headache for my mom is tallying students' " honor points ". By the end of every month, there's always a crowd of students protesting: "Teacher! Why was I penalized here? " or "Teacher! I did the cleaning last week; did you forget to add my points?"
